# FractalErosion
Fractal terrain generation and and droplet erosion

a horrible spaghetti-code to test
- fractal terrain generation (used Hunter Loftis code: http://www.playfuljs.com/realistic-terrain-in-130-lines/)
- use a hydraulic erosion model to make terrain look more realistic (based on the model by Mei/Decaudin/Hu and Jako/Proceedings of CESCG 2011) -> changed this to simpler and much faster droplet erosion model

next steps:
- clean up this mess
- terrain visualization via direction of slope and lightning (Buchin et al.): framework working, flesh out details
